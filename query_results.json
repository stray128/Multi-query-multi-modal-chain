  "At what period in history did the EV / NTM Multiples cross 40x for the top 5 medians?": "The EV / NTM revenue multiples for the top 5 medians crossed 40x around November 2020. This is indicated by the peak in the blue line representing the top 5 median values on the chart.",
  "Describe the cost optimizations on GPT 4 Turbo compared to GPT 4?": "The cost optimizations of GPT-4 Turbo compared to GPT-4 are significant and can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Cost Reduction**: \n   - GPT-4 Turbo is **3 times cheaper** for input tokens and **2 times cheaper** for output tokens compared to GPT-4.\n   - Specifically, the costs are:\n     - **Input Tokens**: $0.01 per 1,000 tokens\n     - **Output Tokens**: $0.03 per 1,000 tokens\n   - On a blended basis, GPT-4 Turbo is approximately **2.5 to 3 times cheaper** than GPT-4.\n\n2. **Increased Context Length**: \n   - The context window for GPT-4 Turbo has been expanded from **8,000 tokens to 128,000 tokens**. This allows for a much larger amount of text (around 300 pages) to be processed in a single prompt, enhancing the model's usability and flexibility.\n\n3. **Implications of Cost Reductions**:\n   - The decrease in costs lowers the barrier for experimentation with AI technologies, making it more accessible for developers and businesses.\n   - It also facilitates the integration of AI functionalities into production environments without significantly increasing costs for vendors.\n   - As context windows increase, the need for task-specific or fine-tuned models may decrease, potentially simplifying the development process.\n\nOverall, these optimizations are expected to drive a surge in AI applications, particularly in 2024, as the technology becomes more affordable and effective.",
  "Which company had the highest difference in the actual and consensus of the quarterly reported revenue?": "The provided image does not contain information about actual and consensus quarterly reported revenue for companies. It displays a chart titled \"Growth Adjusted EV / NTM Revenue (EV / NTM Rev / NTM Growth)\" with various companies listed along the x-axis and their corresponding values on the y-axis.\n\nTo answer your question about the highest difference in actual and consensus quarterly reported revenue, I would need specific data regarding actual revenues and consensus estimates for those companies. If you have that information, please share it, and I can help analyze it.",
  "Out of the companies listed which company has the highest delta in the YTD share price percentage?": "The company with the highest delta in the YTD share price percentage is **Datadog**, with a YTD share price increase of **36%**."
